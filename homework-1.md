###Decentralised Systems

Discuss in your team [Group 21](https://airtable.com/shr4M1HXv2q6UseN4/tblotSYReEmIuugYo) what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be
like, if there was no software on a central server.

How would you solve the problems of:

- cheating ensuring agreement about the state of the system communication problems (timeouts)
- how to decide who should take the next turn
- how to allow the correct people to join the game

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed design.
