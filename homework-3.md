Compiling the provided simple storage contract below

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

/**
 * @title Storage
 * @dev Store & retrieve value in a variable
 * @custom:dev-run-script ./scripts/deploy_with_ethers.ts
 */
contract Storage {

    uint256 number;

    /**
     * @dev Store value in variable
     * @param num value to store
     */
    function store(uint256 num) public {
        number = num;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Return value 
     * @return value of 'number'
     */
    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256){
        return number;
    }
}
```

we get the following ABI

```json
[
	{
		"inputs": [],
		"name": "retrieve",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "uint256",
				"name": "",
				"type": "uint256"
			}
		],
		"stateMutability": "view",
		"type": "function"
	},
	{
		"inputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "uint256",
				"name": "num",
				"type": "uint256"
			}
		],
		"name": "store",
		"outputs": [],
		"stateMutability": "nonpayable",
		"type": "function"
	}
]
```

we can see that the ABI is related to the contract's code in the sense that it gives a structured information about the functions contained in the code. Specifically it declares the `name` of the functions, and which `inputs` and `outputs` they accept/provide, defining also which mutability state the functions refer to. The ABI schema having also a `type` specification leaves rooms to suppose that it will also support other kind of data definitions, not only the functions one we see in the sample contract above.
